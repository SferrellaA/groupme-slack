# groupme-slack
In 2019 I was President of a club that used GroupMe as our main communication platform. We ran into an issue where most users would mute the GroupMe to avoid notification spam, and therefore were not notified of more important communications. I decided to migrate the club to Slack so that users could mute individual channels while leaving the announcements channel unmuted. Because most users had GroupMe muted however, it wasn't feasible to have everyone switch apps all at once.

To facilitate a gradual migration, I wrote this tool. It's a simple program that uses [Slack](https://api.slack.com/start) and [GroupMe](https://dev.groupme.com/tutorials/bots) bots to copy messages back and forth. I ended up running this tool for ~a month and a half, which cost me ~$7 on an AWS t2 micro instance. While not free, this was way cheaper than [sameroom.io](https://sameroom.io/). There's a few bugs with groupme-slack, and I wouldn't use it outside a club environment. If I find myself needing a tool like this again in the future I'll probably do a full re-write.
